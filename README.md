# Computer-Graphics

A repository for all OpenGL code... being updated gradually
# Lab 1
-	Created my first OGL program.
-	Learned to create a window, and set a window size and position.
-	Learned to set the background display color.
-	Learned to implement sound files in my program

# Lab 2
-	Learned about OpenGL Geometric Primitives.
-	Created my virtual world using GL_POLYGON, GL_TRIANGLES, and GL_LINE_STRIP.
-	I used glColor3f to fill the color of the Triangle and Polygon.

# Lab 3
-	Created a FatPaintBrush program with a reshape, keyboard, mouse, motion handler, and Viewport.
-	Successfully ran DinoPolyLine File which takes a .txt/.dat file and displays a Dino.
-	Completed DinoTilling using a for loop creates a new Viewport for each iteration and creates a dino.
-	Completed Dino invert Tilling using nested for loops.
-	Completed Dino Zoom in and out using Keys, which zooms in on the up arrow key zooms out on the down arrow key, and reposts the display with updated value.
-	Completed viewport panning in which the viewport is variable and can be increased and decreased using a mouse or keyboard
-	Created a parametrized Regular polygon and n-gon using lineTo and moveTo functions.
-	Implemented the code for Arc.
-	Implemented the code for Rose Curves.
-	Implemented the code for Rosette (Example from the book).
-	Created a circle using equation: x + r*cosØ, y + r*sinØ

# Lab 4
-	Implemented and created an Arrow using moveTo and lineTo functions.
-	Figure 3.27 rosette 
-	Implemented and completed Figure 2.44 menu (attached menu with right mouse button)

# Lab 5
-	Created my Paint Program: 
-	Learned to render/write text on screen
-	Used vector array to draw dots, clicking the left mouse button will create dots and the right mouse clears the dots (push and pop in array)
-	Created a shape class that is inherited by different shapes like Triangles, circles, pentagons, cylinder 
-	Used keyboard handler to render and delete shapes on the screen, on pressing a key a shape is drawn and deleted. (push and pop in vector array)
-	Implemented Point2 class and Turtle Graphics:
-	Example 3.5.2 (motifs)
-	Practice Exercises-> 3.5.1 – 3.5.6 (motifs and meanders)
-	Practice Exercises-> 3.5.7 – 3.5.9 (Polyspirals)

# Lab 6
-	Created a Mario 2D game, learned about RGBApixmap, Enum datatype, reading a bmp file, setting a chromakey, Special keyboard functions and how to move a bmp on screen using keyboard interactions.

# Lab 7
-	Canvas Class implementation with some more classes including Point2, IntRect, and RealRect.
-	Created my own 3 functions drawSun(), drawStar(), and drawSmiley() using Canvas Class.

# Lab 8
-	Spider game lab: 
-	Physics engine to check collision between spider & bullet.
-	Bounce back logic of the spider if it reaches the wall of the window.
-	Object modeling Bullet. 
-	Use of the gettime() function to determine the speed of the spider at each point second.

# Lab 9
-	Usage of 2D transformations
- Usage of push & pop matrix for transformations of windmill blade 
-	Timer Function which increments the value of the angle so the windmill keeps rotating.
-	Plane (object) landing using the Timer function.

# Lab 10
-	Using Transformations to create flakes and a star.
-	Dino transformations.

# Lab 11
-	Modeling and animating a gear wheel.
-	Drawing a symmetric object (snowflake) using a Turtle.

# Lab 12
-	Model a 2D car using transformations and animate it using the Timer function, attached menu to start, restart & exit the program.
-	Example of a 2D robot for hierarchical modeling, by using these solutions:
-	Independent / Non – hierarchical
-	Dependent / Hierarchical.

# Lab 13
-	Example 5.6.2: A scene composed of wireframe objects.
-	Example 5.6.3. A 3D scene rendered with shading.
