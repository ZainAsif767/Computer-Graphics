# Computer-Graphics

A repository for all OpenGL code... being updated gradually
# Lab 1
-	Created my first OGL program.
-	Learned to create a window, and set a window size and position.
-	Learned to set the background display color.
-	Learned to implement sound files in my program

# Lab 2
-	Learned about OpenGL Geometric Primitives.
-	Created my virtual world using GL_POLYGON, GL_TRIANGLES, and GL_LINE_STRIP.
-	I used glColor3f to fill the color of the Triangle and Polygon.

# Lab 3
-	Created a FatPaintBrush program with a reshape, keyboard, mouse, motion handler, and Viewport.
-	Successfully ran DinoPolyLine File which takes a .txt/.dat file and displays a Dino.
-	Completed DinoTilling using a for loop creates a new Viewport for each iteration and creates a dino.
-	Completed Dino invert Tilling using nested for loops.
-	Completed Dino Zoom in and out using Keys, which zooms in on the up arrow key zooms out on the down arrow key, and reposts the display with updated value.
-	Completed viewport panning in which the viewport is variable and can be increased and decreased using a mouse or keyboard
-	Created a parametrized Regular polygon and n-gon using lineTo and moveTo functions.
-	Implemented the code for Arc.
-	Implemented the code for Rose Curves.
-	Implemented the code for Rosette (Example from the book).
-	Created a circle using equation: x + r*cosØ, y + r*sinØ

# Lab 4
-	Implemented and created an Arrow using moveTo and lineTo functions.
-	Figure 3.27 rosette 
-	Implemented and completed Figure 2.44 menu (attached menu with right mouse button)
